nang,

I know you suffered a lot because of me. I see now the pain I caused, and I am truly sorry. I know I have many flaws, and sometimes I am hard to understand and hard to love. To be honest, there are days I don’t even like myself because I see the same mistakes again and again.

If one day we end up separated, I will understand. I will not blame you, and I will accept it, even if it hurts me deeply. You stayed and loved me even when I was difficult, and I will always be thankful for that. You never deserved the confusion and the heaviness I gave you.

But please remember this, no matter what happens — I love you so, so, so much. My love for you is real and sincere. Even if we are not together someday, you will always have a special place in my heart, and I will always pray for your peace, your happiness, and your healing.

I want you to know I am trying to change. I am doing my best to grow and become a better person, and to become a Godly man — someone who can love with patience, respect, and a clean heart. I want to be a man who can lead a family with faith, love his wife sincerely, and teach Godly ways to his children. I am praying, learning, and correcting myself little by little. I want my life to please the Lord. Hopefully, I will be able to do all of this with you.

i love you, ren.
