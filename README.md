my love, hai

I know you suffered a lot because of me. I see now the pain I caused, and I am truly sorry. I know I have many flaws, and sometimes I am hard to understand and hard to love. To be honest, there are days I don’t even like myself because I see the same mistakes again and again.

If one day we end up separated, I will understand. I will not blame you, and I will accept it, even if it hurts me deeply. You stayed and loved me even when I was difficult, and I will always be thankful for that. You never deserved the confusion and the heaviness I gave you.

But please remember this, no matter what happens — I love you so, so, so much. My love for you is real and sincere. Even if we are not together someday, you will always have a special place in my heart, and I will always pray for your peace, your happiness, and your healing.

Thank you for loving me when I was not easy to love.

I always right your name to test a pen.


i love you ren.

Romans 8:38–39
“For I am convinced that neither death nor life… nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
